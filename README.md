# Karyra Spark

> **Learn Crypto Safely, Grow Together**

Karyra Spark is a mobile-first, open-source SvelteKit frontend for a Blockchain and Starknet readiness gateway — a structured educational platform that guides Indonesian-speaking users through blockchain fundamentals, safe wallet practices, and the Starknet ecosystem one step at a time.

The platform is intentionally *not* a trading tool. It begins with understanding and safety, and only opens the door to wallets, testnets, and ecosystem exploration once users have demonstrated readiness.

**Live demo:** [spark.user.cloudjkt01.com](https://spark.user.cloudjkt01.com)
**Status:** `BETA 0.1` — mobile-first, with Starknet integrations rolling out progressively

## Overview

Many blockchain beginners drop out before they even start — because they are immediately confronted with wallets, seed phrases, and live transactions before they understand the basics. Spark solves this with a clear, gated learning path:

**Understand → Practice safely → Prove readiness → Explore the ecosystem**

All content is in Bahasa Indonesia and designed around the needs of local learners and community facilitators. The platform is built mobile-first because that is how most of the target audience accesses the web.

## Key Features

**Core Curriculum (`/core`)**
A three-level learning track — Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced — covering blockchain fundamentals, cryptocurrency concepts, wallet security, Web3 applications, and Starknet. Each level is gated behind a passing score (≥ 70%) on a level-end exam. Topics include:
- Why blockchain and digital trust
- How shared ledgers work
- Cryptocurrency and network fees — without speculative framing
- Seed phrases, private keys, signature hygiene, and scam awareness
- Wallet connections, transaction simulation, and block explorers
- Starknet, account abstraction, testnet, and developer tooling

**Practice Lab (`/lab`)**
A safe simulation environment with no real assets. Exercises are leveled (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and include scenarios like:
- Recognising dangerous wallet requests
- Step-by-step safe-wallet checklists
- Transaction simulations and Starknet sandbox exercises

Lab results feed directly into a user's Readiness Passport.

**Readiness Passport (`/passport`)**
An aggregated proof-of-readiness record built from a user's learning progress, lab completion, and community participation. Acts as a lightweight on-platform credential before the user moves into live ecosystem exploration.

**Spark Hub (`/hub`)**
A curated gateway to Starknet resources, tools, apps, and ecosystem missions, accessible once a baseline level of readiness has been established. The Hub can run as a sub-path (`/hub`) or as a standalone service on a separate port.

**Community (`/community`)**
Workshops, cohorts, and discussion spaces moderated by local facilitators. The community layer reinforces learning with peer interaction and live events.

**Dashboard & Inbox (`/dashboard`, `/inbox`)**
Personalised progress summaries and in-app notifications to keep learners oriented and on track.

## Learning Journey

```
Core Beginner  →  Core Intermediate  →  Core Advanced
      ↓                   ↓                    ↓
  Lab Beginner  →  Lab Intermediate  →  Lab Advanced
                          ↓
                  Readiness Passport
                          ↓
               Hub + Community Exploration
```

Each stage is unlocked only after completing the previous level's exam with a ≥ 70% score. This progression ensures no learner is pushed into wallet or testnet interactions before they are ready.

## Deployment

### Docker (Staging)

The repository includes `Dockerfile.staging`, a multi-stage build targeting `node:22-alpine`. The resulting image runs the compiled SvelteKit Node server on port **4173**.

**Build the image:**

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_API_BASE="https://api.yourdomain.com" \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_SPARK_API_BASE="https://api.yourdomain.com" \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_SPARK_HUB_URL="/hub/" \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_SPARK_APP_URL="https://spark.yourdomain.com" \
  --build-arg PUBLIC_SPARK_MODE="production" \
  --build-arg ORIGIN="https://spark.yourdomain.com" \
  -f Dockerfile.staging \
  -t karyra-spark:staging .
```

**Run the container:**

```bash
docker run -p 4173:4173 karyra-spark:staging
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4173`.

> **Note:** Build-time `ARG` values are baked into the static bundle. For environment-specific deployments, pass the correct `--build-arg` values at build time rather than at runtime.
